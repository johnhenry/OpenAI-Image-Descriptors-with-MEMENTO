# OpenAI Image Descriptors with MEMENTO

This is code for the Adafruit Momento camera.
It's based on Lin Clark's code [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/openai-image-descriptors-with-memento/circuitpython-code).

This project has been modified to:

- Have sorter, more concise variable names (memory footprint)
- Dynamic loading of prompts
- Backup WiFi connection
